# HYBRID ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS FOR ANOMALY DETECTION IN loT HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data instances that drastically
deviate from most data instances. Anomaly detection in healthcare is an ongoing research
theme especially when concerning IoT devices, which are quickly spreading throughout
various situations of peopleâ€™s life. The majority of current anomaly detection methods are
highly specific to the individual use case, requiring expert knowledge of the technique as
well as the situation in which it is being applied. The Internet of Things (IoT) as a rapidly
expanding field offers many opportunities for this type of data analysis to be implemented,
however, due to the nature of the IoT, this may be difficult. Anomalies in ECG data
may lead to false alarms and disease prediction can become uncertain. In order to avoid
this, anomalies in ECG data have to be detected and treated accordingly This project proposes a hybrid
model involving Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks
(GAN) for detecting anomalies in MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset which contains Electrocardiograms of 47 subjects, each with 140 data
points.
